# Project Plan

**Author**: Alex Bayer

## 1 Introduction
This is a single user app created to compare job options to each other or to the user's current job using a variety of information about each option.

## 2 Process Description
#### 1. Inception
- **Description:** The ideation phase of the solution development, starting with a general intent and proceeding through the gathering and analysis of requirements from the user or users of the product. This includes working with the user to create a set of detailed, explicit use cases and requirements that will guide the development and testing of the solution, and be used to define successful completion of the product.
- **Entrance Criteria:**
  1. Request for a product from the user
  2. Statement of product intent or goals from the user
  3. A draft of user stories (user requirements) from the user
- **Exit Criteria:**
  1. Draft use case model 
  2. Draft solution architecture
  3. Draft solution class diagram

<br>

#### 1. Elaboration
- **Description:** Requirements of the system are further refined during this phase through continuing discussion amongst the design team and with the user or users. Documentation of the planned system is expanded, with more complete modelling of the planned solution. The designed product is analyzed against the use case model with the user, with changes made to the design or use case model to when needed to better meet user needs. A test plan is also developed from the use case model which will be used during subsequent phases to ensure the implementation of the solution meets the user requirements. Limited implementation of the designed product is begun to facilitate analysis of the design of the system.
- **Entrance Criteria:**
  1. Draft use case model
  2. Draft solution architecture
  3. Draft solution class diagram
- **Exit Criteria:**
  1. Documented solution assumptions and accepted constraints
  2. Refined use case model
  3. Refined solution architecture
  4. Refined solution class diagram
  5. Solution test plan
  6. Component diagram
  7. Deployment diagram
  8. User interface design and draft user manual
  9. Stakeholder (user) agreement that the intent can be achieved by the current design and plan
  10. Optional prototype solution
  11. Resource estimate for design completion
  12. Project plan

<br>

#### 1. Construction
- **Description:** During this phase the solution as designed is developed and tested in accordance with the solution test plan. The solution is deployed and tested on representative platforms to verify stability and by select users to ensure the user experience is acceptable.The design of the solution may be revised as more knowledge is gained during construction, but all changes must be reviewed with the stakeholders and implemented into the full design documentation, including the test plan and test cases. 
- **Entrance Criteria:**
  1. Stable solution intent
  2. Stable use case model
  3. Stable solution design
     1. Architecture
     2. Class diagram
     3. Test plan
     4. Component diagram
     5. Deployment diagram
     6. User interface design
- **Exit Criteria:**
  1. Complete and functional solution
     1. Complete use case model realized in implementation
     2. Solution integrated on intended platforms
     3. Solution achieving test plan requirements
  2. Complete and accurate set of solution artifacts: design, code, test cases
  3. Complete solution user manual
  4. Concurrence from stakeholders to deploy to the user(s)

<br>

#### 1. Transition
- **Description:** The constructed solution is deployed to the full user community for use. Feedback from users is tracked and considered for further development of the solution, including resolution of software bugs or new feature requests. The health of the solution is monitored, with continuing support provided to the users or stakeholders as agreed upon between the developers and the customer.
- **Entrance Criteria:**
  1. Complete and functional solution
  2. Agreement from the customer on a post deployment support and maintenance plan
  3. Concurrence from stakeholders to deploy to the user(s)
- **Exit Criteria:**
  1. Concurrence from stakeholders to end ongoing solution support and maintenance
